## User Experience (UX)
### Project Goals
The goal of the website was to design and create and informative, interactive and fun website. Offering users knowledge about Scenic Destination locations around the world. The website contains our company logo "Scenic Destinations", "Home" "Login" & "Register", which are linked to additional pages on the site. Each page has a matching banner/header page and also a matching footer page. The footer includes social media links that open in seperate links for their respective sites. The colour of each social link will change to green and increase in size on a hover action.
